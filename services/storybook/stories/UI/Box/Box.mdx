# Box

Box is the **foundational building block** of our design system. It's a minimal abstraction over HTML elements that provides styling capabilities while maintaining maximum flexibility.

**Think of Box as:** A styling-enabled `<div>` that can become any HTML element.

Box is designed to be:

- **Minimal** - No built-in layout logic or predefined styles
- **Flexible** - Can render as any HTML element via `as` prop
- **Universal** - The base layer for all other components (Stack, Card, Button, etc.)
- **Unopinionated** - You control everything

## When to Use Box

### ✅ Use Box when:

- You need a simple **wrapper** or **container**
- You want **semantic HTML** (`as="section"`, `as="article"`, `as="nav"`)
- You're building a **custom component** from scratch
- You need **maximum control** with minimal abstraction
- None of the specialized components fit your needs

### ❌ Consider alternatives when:

- You need **vertical/horizontal stacking** → Use **Stack** or **Inline**
- You need **center alignment** → Use **Center**
- You're building a **card** → Use **Card** component
- You need **button behavior** → Use **Button** component

> 💡 **Rule of thumb:** If there's a specialized component for your use case, use it. Box is for everything else.

## Box vs Other Components

| Component  | Purpose                     | Built on          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Box**    | General-purpose container   | -                 |
| **Stack**  | Vertical/horizontal layouts | Box + flex logic  |
| **Inline** | Horizontal layouts          | Box + flex(row)   |
| **Center** | Center alignment            | Box + centering   |
| **Card**   | Card-style containers       | Box + card styles |

**All components inherit Box's capabilities**, but add specific behavior or styling.

## Examples

These examples demonstrate **Box-specific features** like polymorphism and styling composition.

For layout patterns (flex, stack, grid), see **Stack**, **Inline**, and **Center** components.
